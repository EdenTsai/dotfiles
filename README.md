### XDG Base Directory

The [XDG Base Directory Specification] specification defines
where these files should be looked for by defining one or more
base directories relative to which files should be located.

-   See [XDG Base Directory Specification] for more details.
-   See [ArchWiki - XDG Base Directory] for supported applications,\
    or how to workaround the unsupported applications
    with XDG base directories.
